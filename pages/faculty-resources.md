### CLA Centers and Labs
**Center for the Humanities at Temple (CHAT)**<br>
The [Center for the Humanities at Temple (CHAT)](https://www.cla.temple.edu/center-for-the-humanities/) is an interdisciplinary forum for scholarship and intellectual inquiry in the humanities at Temple University. We work to bridge the disciplinary divide between departments and colleges by promoting broad, humanities-based conversations that connect scholars from multiple scholarly fields.

**Center for Sustainable Communities**<br>
The [Center for Sustainable Communities](http://www.cla.temple.edu/center-for-sustainable-communities/) at Temple University conducts integrated social and environmental research on natural, technological, and socio-economic systems to address the challenges of sustainability—how can we meet the needs of people locally and globally through equitable, innovative and practical solutions that protect the environment which sustains life on the planet.

**Public Policy Lab**<br>
The [Public Policy Lab](http://www.cla.temple.edu/public-policy-lab/) is an intellectual home for researchers who study public policies and the social processes relevant to their development and consequences. Housed in the College of Liberal Arts, the non-partisan Lab provides an interdisciplinary forum for discussion of contemporary policy issues, research support for faculty and student scholarship and a mechanism to disseminate participants’ research findings.

**Institute for Survey Research**<br>
The [Institute for Survey Research](https://www.cla.temple.edu/institute-for-survey-research/) is one of only three academic survey research centers in the U.S. with the historical experience of implementing national computer-assisted in-person surveys. We are known for the consistently high quality of our work, our high response rates, and our expertise and success in tracing longitudinal study participants. We collaborate with faculty and other researchers around the country and the world on surveys and evaluations across a broad range of fields, topics and populations.

### Provost Funding
Temple University offers annual opportunities for faculty to pursue professional development, conduct research and/or creative activities and/or develop methods and materials that improve teaching and curricula. Eligible faculty are encouraged to apply for Grant-in-Aid Awards, Summer Research Awards and sabbaticals. For more information and submission deadlines, please look out for announcements throughout the fall semester.

### Office of the Vice President for Research (OVPR)
Temple University’s Office of the Vice President for Research offers specialized services and resources to advance faculty research across the university. The Presidential Arts and Humanities Awards through OVPR offer faculty a wonderful funding opportunity within the university. The OVPR Grant Academy provides grant writing training that is individualized for nominated CLA faculty.
