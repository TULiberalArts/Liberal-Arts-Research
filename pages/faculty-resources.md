## CLA Centers, Institutes and Labs

### Center for the Humanities at Temple (CHAT)
The [Center for the Humanities at Temple (CHAT)](https://www.cla.temple.edu/center-for-the-humanities/) is an interdisciplinary forum for scholarship and intellectual inquiry in the humanities at Temple University. We work to bridge the disciplinary divide between departments and colleges by promoting broad, humanities-based conversations that connect scholars from multiple scholarly fields.

### Center for Sustainable Communities
The [Center for Sustainable Communities](http://www.cla.temple.edu/center-for-sustainable-communities/) at Temple University conducts integrated social and environmental research on natural, technological, and socio-economic systems to address the challenges of sustainability—how can we meet the needs of people locally and globally through equitable, innovative and practical solutions that protect the environment which sustains life on the planet.

### Public Policy Lab
The [Public Policy Lab](http://www.cla.temple.edu/public-policy-lab/) is an intellectual home for researchers who study public policies and the social processes relevant to their development and consequences. Housed in the College of Liberal Arts, the non-partisan Lab provides an interdisciplinary forum for discussion of contemporary policy issues, research support for faculty and student scholarship and a mechanism to disseminate participants’ research findings.

### Institute for Survey Research
The [Institute for Survey Research](https://www.cla.temple.edu/institute-for-survey-research/) is one of only three academic survey research centers in the U.S. with the historical experience of implementing national computer-assisted in-person surveys. We are known for the consistently high quality of our work, our high response rates, and our expertise and success in tracing longitudinal study participants. We collaborate with faculty and other researchers around the country and the world on surveys and evaluations across a broad range of fields, topics and populations.

## Liberal Arts Undergraduate Research Awards (LAURAs)
The [Liberal Arts Undergraduate Research Awards (LAURA)](https://www.cla.temple.edu/liberal-arts-research/undergraduate-research/liberal-arts-undergraduate-research-awards/) creates more opportunities for undergraduate students to develop research skills by working with faculty mentors on faculty-led research projects while increasing support for faculty research in the College of Liberal Arts.

## College of Liberal Arts Research Awards (CLARAs)
The Dean of CLA invites applications from all tenured and tenure-track faculty for CLA Research Awards (CLARA) to support their research. Preference will be given to those who have not received internal funding from any source this past academic year. These funds are available to support new or ongoing research.
