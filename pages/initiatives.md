The College of Liberal Arts exemplifies Temple University’s core values of diversity and inclusion: creating and sustaining a teaching, learning, and research community that not only includes but welcomes and values differences based on religion, race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, veteran status, age, and family/marital status. To harness the value that diversity and inclusiveness have within the CLA community, the Diversity, Equity and Anti-Bias Advisory Board was established in 2018. Members of the Board are the Dean, two Senior Associate Deans, and four faculty members of different ranks. Four times a year, the Dean’s office reports to the Board on initiatives and progress on achieving a diverse and inclusive faculty, staff, and student body. For more information about diversity initiatives for faculty and students in the College of Liberal Arts please see below:

### Postdoctoral Diversity Fellowship Program
The Postdoctoral Diversity Fellowship Program supports the development of early career scholars from diverse backgrounds with particular attention to historically under-represented groups among the professorial faculties of colleges and universities in the United States as well as to increase the diversity of the community of scholars devoted to academic research at Temple University. These are one-year positions with a 0-1 teaching load designed to give Diversity and Inclusion scholars time to begin research immediately after completing their PhDs in an intellectually rich and supportive environment.

## ACLS Postdoctoral Fellowship in Philosophy of Race
The College of Liberal Arts was one of only three initial national recipients of the Postdoctoral Partnership Initiative grant from the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS). Our postdoctoral fellowship search was in Philosophy of Race. This fall 2020, the Department of Philosophy was thrilled to welcome **[César Cabezas Gamarra](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/cabezas-c-sar)**, from Columbia University. 

## ACLS Postdoctoral Partnership Initiative
![ACLS logo]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resizedfullaclslogo.png){:.responsive-img .img-right}
ACLS is pleased to announce three new partnerships that reflect our commitment to supporting institutional efforts to increase the diversity of college and university faculty. Through this program, **The City College of New York, Haverford College, Temple University, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and University of Kentucky** were each offered a two-year postdoctoral fellowship for promising early career scholars from historically underrepresented groups such as black/African American, American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Hispanic/Latino scholars. The institutions appointed these fellows with the intent to promote them to Assistant Professor roles at the end of the fellowship period. Support for ACLS’s Postdoctoral Partnership Initiative is made possible by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.  For more information about this initiative please visit the [**ACLS website**](https://www.acls.org/programs/ppi/).

### Diversity Predoctoral Fellowships in Liberal Arts - 
(Pilot Program)
The purpose of the Diversity Predoctoral Fellowships program is to enhance diversity in the College of Liberal Arts and the higher education community by providing college graduates with additional professional support and mentoring as they enter their fields. The program is envisioned for college graduates who belong to a wide range of backgrounds, and who will benefit from an additional year of training before pursuing a doctoral degree. Applicants from members of racial and ethnic groups that have historically been underrepresented in the humanities and social sciences, are encouraged to apply. The fellowship will cover tuition costs for up to 12 credit hours (four courses) during one academic year. Incoming fellows will have the opportunity to study with advanced doctoral students, work closely with a faculty mentor, and receive training in research methods for specific departments.

### CLA Future Faculty Assistantship Program
In 1987, the Future Faculty Fellows Program (currently known as the Future Faculty Assistantship Program or “FFA Program”) was established at Temple University to promote and increase diversity among the American professoriate through fellowship awards to newly admitted underrepresented domestic graduate students. In 2019, the fellowship program was redesigned, and colleges now oversee the selection process. **The CLA Future Faculty Assistantship Program** also offers annual assistantships that ensure summer funding.

Academic Affairs in CLA has created a new multifaceted mentoring approach for the participants in the program. This new initiative includes:

**Group Mentoring**<br>
Participants attend regular meetings of the new cohort in a given year (organized by the Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, and the Director of Graduate Studies). These meetings are intended to provide opportunities for incoming fellows to share insights, discoveries, and questions. We feature former Future Faculty Fellows, members of the faculty, administrators, or external seasoned experts addressing issues of interest to new participants, including professional development opportunities.

**Mentoring Support from an Experienced Future Faculty Fellow**<br>
Since 2020, all incoming fellows are invited to participate in the new CLA FFA Mentorship Program. Through the program, graduate students receive mentorship and constructive support from former Future Faculty Fellows. The mentoring partnership is purely voluntary on the part of both parties, and it may be ended at either's request. It involves no formal review of each mentee’s performance, and all information shared with the mentor is to be considered confidential.
